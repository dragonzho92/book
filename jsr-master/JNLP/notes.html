<h1>Notes</h1>

<p><a name="1" id="1"></a>1 The term <em>provisioning</em> is commonly used to 
  denote the distribution of software components, such as an application, from 
  a central server to a set of client machines. This is sometime also referred 
  to as deployment of an application. </p>
<p><a name="2"></a>2 The <em>provisioning protocol</em> defined in this specification 
  also allows a JRE to be packaged on a Web server for automatic installation 
  on the client machine by a JNLP Client.</p>
<p><a name="3" id="3"></a>3 The <em>image files</em> described in the JNLP file 
  are icons that can be used by the JNLP Client to integrate the application into 
  the desktop environment. They are not for use by the application itself. All 
  application resources, such as images, must generally either be included in 
  one of the JAR files or be explicitly downloaded using, e.g, an HTTP request.</p>
<p><a name="4" id="4"></a>4 In Sun's Java 2 SE JREs, <em>proxy settings</em> can 
  be specified using the <code>proxyHost</code> and <code>proxyPort</code> system 
  properties.</p>
<p><a name="5" id="5"></a>5 Language codes are defined by ISO 639, and country 
  codes by ISO 3166.</p>
<p><a name="6" id="6"></a>6 The <em>current locale</em> for a JNLP Client could, 
  for example, be the one returned by <code>Locale.getDefault()</code>.</p>
<p><a name="7" id="7"></a>7 A <em>native library</em> is also called a DLL (dynamic 
  linked library) on Windows and a shared object file (<code>.so</code>) on UNIX 
  systems.</p>
<p><a name="8" id="8"></a>8 See <code>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html</code></p>
<p><a name="9" id="9"></a>9 See <code>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/extensions/versioning.html</code></p>
<p><a name="10" id="10"></a>10 This practice is followed starting from Java 2 
  SE JRE 1.3.0 for Sun's implementations. The java.version <em>system property</em> 
  is &quot;1.2.2&quot; for several different product versions, such as &quot;1.2.2-w&quot; 
  (final release) and &quot;1.2.2-001&quot; (patch release). As a workaround, 
  to determine the actual product version, use java -fullversion.</p>
<p><a name="11" id="11"></a>11 The above URL is only used as an <em>example</em>. 
  The exact URL for naming Sun's JREs is likely to be different.</p>
<p><a name="12" id="12"></a>12 Except for permissions, if the component extension 
  and application descriptor specified different permissions in the security element.</p>
<p><a name="13" id="13"></a>13 The J2SE sercurity permissions are fully described 
  in <code>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/ security/permissions.html</code>.)</p>
<p><a name="14" id="14"></a>14 The plus sign (+) in the version string is converted 
  into the %2B given the standard encoding for arguments in URLs</p>
<p><a name="15" id="15"></a>15 The specification restricts the version-id's to 
  only contain ASCII characters due to the well-defined ordering of ASCII characters 
  based on the ASCII value.</p>
<p><a name="16" id="16"></a>16 This is treating the tuple as e.g. a Lisp list.</p>
<p><a name="17" id="17"></a>17 The <code>java.io.RandomAccessFile</code> is not 
  used since most of its methods are final. Thus, it would be impossible to implement 
  a JNLP Client that returns a subclass of RandomAccssFile that implements, e.g., 
  metered access to the file system.</p>
