<P><BR>This document, the Java&trade; Network Launching Protocol and
API Specification, v6.0, is also known as the JNLP Specification. In
addition to this specification, the Java Network Launching API has
Javadoc documentation (referred to as the JNLP API Reference, v6.0)
and a reference implementation for public download at the following
location:

<P>The reference implementation provides a behavioral benchmark. In
the case of a discrepancy, the order of resolution is this
specification, then the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/guide/jws/jnlp/index.html">JNLP
API Reference, v6.0</A>, and finally the reference implementation.</P>

<H2><A NAME="revision"></A>0.7 Revision History</H2>
<H3>0.7.1 Changes since release 1.0</H3>
<P>This is a minor update of the version 1.0 specification. This
specification update contains no changes nor additions to the JNLP
file or the JNLP API. This update addresses several inconsistencies
and typos in the original specification, as well as one Applet
compatibility issue. The major changes are described below:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Update the untrusted environment
	to include the AWT permission accessEventQueue. This is to comply
	with the Applet sandbox model. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clarified the use of
	encoded/unencoded URLs in a JNLP file. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clarified that the JARDiff index
	file uses the remove command and not the delete command 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Fixed minor typos and inconsistencies in the examples. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>This revision does not introduce new version numbers for the JNLP
file nor the JNLP API. A JNLP Client implementing this specification
must be able to run a JNLP file which requires 1.0, i.e., the spec
attribute in the jnlp element is set to 1.0.</P>
<H3>0.7.2 Changes since release 1.0.1</H3>
<P>This is a minor update of the version 1.0.1 specification. This
specification update contains several additions to the JNLP file and
to the JNLP API. This update also addresses several inconsistencies
and typographical errors in the original specification. The major
changes are described below:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added <CODE>SingleInstanceService</CODE>
	and <CODE>ExtendedService</CODE> to the JNLP API; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">added <CODE>&lt;shortcut&gt;</CODE>,
	<CODE>&lt;associations&gt;</CODE>, and <CODE>&lt;related-content&gt;</CODE>
	elements to the information block in the jnlp file; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">added &quot;java-vm-args&quot;
	attribute to the &lt;j2se&gt; element in the jnlp file; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">added <CODE>os</CODE>, <CODE>arch</CODE>,
	and <CODE>platform</CODE> attributes to the <CODE>&lt;information&gt;</CODE>
	element in the jnlp file; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">added ampersand (<CODE>&amp;</CODE>)
	modifier to the <CODE>version-range</CODE> argument to allow
	compound versions; 
	</P>
	<LI><P>clarified several sections and fixed typographical errors in
	the previous version. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>This revision does introduces the version number (1.5) for the
JNLP file and the JNLP API. Version 1.5 is a proper superset of 1.0.
A JNLP Client implementing this specification must be able to run a
JNLP file which requires either 1.0 or 1.5; i.e., the <CODE>spec</CODE>
attribute in the jnlp element is set to either 1.0 or 1.5.</P>

<H3>0.7.3 Changes since release 1.5</H3>
<P>This is a minor update of the version 1.5 specification. This
specification update contains several additions to the JNLP file and
no changes to the  JNLP API. This update also addresses several
inconsistencies and typographical errors in the original
specification. The major changes are described below:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Added &ldquo;update&rdquo; element, and its args &ldquo;check&rdquo;
	and &ldquo;policy&rdquo; to allow application to specify its
	preferences for updating, and to relieve overloading of
	&ldquo;offline-allowed&rdquo; element.</P>
	<LI><P>Added &ldquo;description&rdquo; and &ldquo;icon&rdquo;
	elements to the &ldquo;association&rdquo; element to allow
	application to better describe an association.</P>
	<LI><P>Added &ldquo;java&rdquo; element to eventually replace &ldquo;j2se&rdquo;
	element for describing java versions and attributes.</P>
	<LI><P>Modified description of the DownloadService API to allow
	downloading resources not listed in the jnlp file in several cases.</P>
	<LI><P>Clarified several sections and fixed typographical errors in
	the previous version. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.3in"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This revision introduces the version number (6.0) for the
JNLP file and the JNLP API. Version 6.0 is a proper superset of 1.0,
and of version 1.5.  A JNLP Client implementing this specification
must be able to run a JNLP file which requires 1.0, 1.5, or 6.0;
i.e., the <CODE>spec</CODE> attribute in the jnlp element is set to
any of 1.0, 1.5, or 6.0.</P>
