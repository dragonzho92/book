<h1>4 Application Resources</h1>
<hr>
<p><br>
  The <code>resources</code> element is used to specify all the resources, such 
  as Java class files, native libraries, and system properties, that are part 
  of an application. </p>
<h2><a name="overview"></a>4.1 Overview</h2>
<p>The <code>resources</code> element has 7 different possible subelements: jar, 
  nativelib, java, j2se, property, package, and extension. These are all described in 
  detail below.</p>
<p>A resources definition can be restricted to a specific operating system, architecture, 
  or locale using the os, arch, and locale attributes. For example:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;resources&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;java version=&quot;1.6&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;lib/myjar.jar&quot; version=&quot;1.2&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;extension<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name=&quot;coolaudio&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;href=&quot;http://www.mysite.com/ext/coolaudio&quot;&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/extension&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;property name=&quot;key1&quot; value=&quot;value1&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;property name=&quot;key2&quot; value=&quot;value2&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;resources os=&quot;SunOS&quot;&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;lib/motif-plaf.jar&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;/resources&gt;</code></p>
  
</blockquote>
<p><strong><code>os</code> attribute:</strong> Specifies the operating system 
  for which the <code>resources</code> element should be considered. If the value 
  is a prefix of the os.name system property, then the <code>resources</code> 
  element can be used. If the attribute is not specified, it matches all operating 
  systems.</p>
<p><strong><code>arch</code> attribute:</strong> Specifies the architecture for 
  which the <code>resources</code> element should be considered. If the value 
  is a prefix of the os.arch system property, then the <code>resources</code> 
  element can be used. If the attribute is not specified, it matches all architectures.</p>
<p><strong><code>locale</code> attribute:</strong> Specifies that the <code>resources</code> 
  element is locale-dependent. If specified, the <code>resources</code> element 
  should only be used if the default locale for the JNLP Client matches one of 
  the specified locales. If the attribute is not specified, then it matches all 
  locales. The locale is specified and matched as described for the locale attribute 
  of the information element (see Section 3.5).</p>
<p>For the <code>os</code>, <code>arch</code>, and <code>locale</code> attributes 
  several keys can be specified separated with spaces. A space that is part of 
  a key must be preceded with a backslash (\). For example, <code>Windows\ 95 
  Windows\ 98</code> specifies the two keys <code>Windows 95</code> and <code>Windows 
  98</code>. </p>
<h2><a name="setting"></a>4.2 Setting System Properties</h2>
<p>The <code>property</code> element defines a system property that will be available 
  through the <code>System.getProperty</code> and <code>System.getProperties</code> 
  methods. Is has two required attributes: name and value. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;property name=&quot;key1&quot; value=&quot;value1&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Properties must be processed in the order specified in the JNLP file. Thus, 
  if two properties define different values for the same property, then the last 
  value specified in the JNLP file is used. For example, given the following two 
  declarations, in the given order:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;property name=&quot;key&quot; value=&quot;overwritten&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &lt;property name=&quot;key&quot; value=&quot;used&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an untrusted application (see section <a href="launch.html#untrusted">5.5</a>) 
  system properties set in the JNLP file may only be set by the JNLP Client if 
  they are considered secure. At a minimum a JNLP Client will allow setting system 
  properties whose name starts with &quot;jnlp&quot;.</p>
<p>Properties set in the JNLP file may be set by the JNLP Client at any time before 
  the application's code is executed; thus, it cannot be assumed that they will 
  be set during the initialization of the virtual machine. </p>
<p>Properties set in an extension JNLP file may be set any time before code from 
  that extension is executed. <br>
</p>
<h2><a name="specifying"></a>4.3 Specifying Code Resources</h2>
<p>A JNLP file may have two kinds of code resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <code>jar</code> element specifies a JAR file that is part of the application's 
    <code>classpath</code>. The JAR file will be loaded into the JVM using a <code>ClassLoader</code> 
    object. The JAR file will typically contain Java classes that contain the 
    code for the particular application, but can also contain other resources, 
    such as icons and configuration files, that are available through the <code>getResource</code> 
    mechanism.</li>
  <li>A <code>nativelib</code> element specifies a JAR file that contains native 
    libraries<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#7','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">7</a></SUP>. 
    The JNLP Client must ensure that each file entry in the root directory of 
    the JAR file (i.e., <code>/</code>) can be loaded into the running process 
    by the <code>System.loadLibrary</code> method. It is up to the launched application 
    to actually cause the loading of the library (i.e., by calling <code>System.loadLibrary</code>). 
    Each entry must contain a platform-dependent shared library with the correct 
    naming convention, e.g., <code>*.dll</code> on Windows, or <code>lib*.so</code> 
    on Solaris.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following JNLP file fragment shows how <code>jar</code> and <code>nativelib</code> 
  elements are used. Notice that native libraries would typically be included 
  in a <code>resources</code> element that is intended for a particular operating 
  system and architecture.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;resources&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;lib/app.jar&quot; version=&quot;3.2&quot; 
    main=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;resources os=&quot;Windows&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;nativelib href=&quot;lib/windows/corelibs.jar&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;resources os=&quot;SunOS&quot; arch=&quot;SPARC&quot;&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;nativelib href=&quot;lib/solaris/corelibs.jar&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;/resources&gt;</code></p>
  
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>href</code> attribute is the HTTP URL of a JAR file that the application 
  depends on. The optional version attribute describes the required version, as 
  described in Section 3.4. Section 6 describes how JAR files are downloaded. 
  An optional size attribute can be used to indicate the download size of the 
  JAR file in bytes. </p>
<p>The <code>jar</code> element has a <code>main</code> attribute (as shown above) 
  that is used to indicate which JAR file contains the <code>main</code> class 
  of the Application/Applet (or Installer for an extension). There must be at 
  most one <code>jar</code> element in a JNLP file that is specified as <code>main</code>. 
  If no <code>jar</code> element is specified as <code>main</code>, then the first 
  <code>jar</code> element will be considered the <code>main</code> JAR file. 
</p>
<h3>4.3.1 Use of Manifest Files</h3>
<p>A JNLP Client ignores all manifest entries in a JAR file specified with the 
  <code>jar</code> element, except the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The manifest entries used to sign a JAR file are recognized and validated.</li>
  <li>The <code>Main-Class</code> entry in the JAR file specified as <code>main</code> 
    is used to determine the <code>main</code> class of an application (if it 
    is not specified explicitly in the JNLP file). </li>
  <li>The manifest entries used to seal a package are recognized, and the sealing 
    of packages are verified according to the Extension Mechanism Architecture<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#8','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">8</a></SUP>. 
    These are the name and sealed entries.</li>
  <li>The following manifest entries described by the Optional Package Versioning 
    documentation<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#9','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">9</a></SUP>: 
    <code>Extension-Name</code>, <code>Specification-Vendor</code>, <code>Specification-Version</code>, 
    <code>Implementation-Vendor-Id</code>, <code>Implementation-Vendor</code>, 
    and <code>Implementation-Version</code> are recognized and will be available 
    through the <code>java.lang.Package</code> class. They are otherwise not used 
    by a JNLP Client.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a JAR file containing native libraries, i.e., specified with the <code>nativelib</code> 
  element, all manifest entries are ignored except the entries used to sign the 
  JAR file.</p>
<h2><a name="parts"></a>4.4 Parts and Lazy Downloads</h2>
<p>By default, the <code>jar</code> and <code>nativelib</code> resources must 
  be downloaded eagerly, i.e., they are downloaded and available locally to the 
  JVM running the application before the application is launched. The <code>jar</code> 
  and <code>nativelib</code> elements also allow a resource to be specified as 
  lazy. This means that the resource does not necessarily need to be downloaded 
  onto the client system before the application is launched. However, a JNLP Client 
  is always allowed to eagerly download all resources if it chooses. </p>
<p>The download attribute is used to control whether a resource is downloaded 
  eagerly or lazily. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;jar href=&quot;sound.jar&quot; download=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &lt;nativelib href=&quot;native-sound.jar&quot; download=&quot;eager&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default value for the download attribute is eager.</p>
<p>From a functional point of view (i.e., assuming an infinitely fast and reliable 
  network connection), it makes no difference if a JAR file is specified as lazy 
  or eager. The JNLP Client must dynamically download and link in lazily-downloaded 
  JAR files during the execution of the application when they are needed.</p>
<p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will make requests to the application's classloader 
  when it needs to resolve a class that is not currently loaded into the current 
  JVM. The JNLP Client must make sure to intercept these requests (e.g., by installing 
  its own classloader), and if there are JAR files specified in the JNLP file 
  that are currently not loaded into the JVM, then the JNLP Client must download 
  them and load them into the application's JVM.</p>
<p>The<code> jar</code> and <code>nativelib</code> elements also contain a part 
  attribute that can be used to group resources together so they will be downloaded 
  at the same time. Whenever a <code>jar</code> or <code>nativelib</code> resource 
  with a non-empty part attribute is being downloaded, then the JNLP Client must 
  ensure that all other resources that have the same value in the part attribute 
  are also downloaded.</p>
<p>Resources must be downloaded for the following events:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All resources specified as non-lazy must be downloaded before the application 
    is launched: This might trigger download of resources that have the same part 
    name.</li>
  <li>If the JVM triggers a resource to be downloaded through a classloader request, 
    then the classloader must not return until the JAR file containing the requested 
    class is downloaded and all resources (<code>jar</code> or <code>nativelib</code>) 
    that have the same (non-empty) value in the part attribute have been downloaded.</li>
  <li>JAR files and parts can also be requested to be downloaded explicitly by 
    the application program using the JNLP API. This is described in Section 5.3.</li>
</ol>
<p>The part names are local to each JNLP file. The JNLP file for the application 
  might define a part named sound-support, and an extension that is being used 
  by the JNLP descriptor might also define a part named sound-support. These are 
  considered two different part names. Thus, the scope of a part name is the JNLP 
  file.</p>
<p>Native libraries, specified with the <code>nativelib</code> element, can also 
  be downloaded lazily and loaded into the JVM while the application is running. 
  A JVM does not generate requests to the classloader when a native library is 
  missing. Thus, the only way a native library can be triggered to be downloaded 
  and loaded into the JVM process is by using the <code>part</code> attribute. 
  For example, when the Java classes that implement the native wrappers for the 
  native libraries are downloaded, that can also trigger the download of the native 
  library. </p>
<p>The following JNLP fragment shows an example of the use of the <code>jar</code> 
  and <code>nativelib</code> element for lazy download of resources:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;resources&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;sound.jar&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part=&quot;sound&quot; download=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    &lt;resources os=&quot;Windows&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;nativelib href=&quot;sound-native-win.jar&quot; part=&quot;sound&quot; 
    download=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    &lt;resources os=&quot;SunOS&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;nativelib href=&quot;sound-native-solaris.jar&quot; part=&quot;sound&quot; 
    download=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &lt;/resources&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>sound.jar</code> file does not need to be downloaded before the application 
  is launched, because it is specified as a lazy download. The native code for 
  the sound library is also specified as lazy and is also in the sound part. The 
  download of the <code>sound.jar</code> file will trigger the download and loading 
  of the platform-dependent native code, i.e., either <code>sound-native-win.jar</code> 
  on Windows, or s<code>ound-native-solaris.jar</code> on Solaris.</p>
<h2><a name="package"></a>4.5 Package Element</h2>
<p>The package element can be used to indicate to the JNLP Client which packages 
  are implemented in which JAR files. The <code>name</code> attribute specifies 
  a package name, and the <code>part</code> attribute specifies which part must 
  be downloaded in order to load that particular package into the JVM. The package 
  element can take several forms:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;package name=&quot;com.mysite.Main&quot; part=&quot;xyz&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifies that the class <code>com.mysite.Main</code> can be found in the part 
  named xyz.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;package name=&quot;com.mysite.sound.*&quot; part=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifies that classes in the <code>com.mysite.sound</code> package can be 
  found in the <code>part</code> named <code>abc</code>. The use of the &quot;<code>*</code>&quot; 
  is similar to the import statement in the Java Programming Language. Thus, it 
  is not a general-purpose wildcard. Finally, the <code>recursive</code> attribute 
  can be used to specify sub-packages as well; e.g.,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;package name=&quot;com.mysite.sound.*&quot; part=&quot;stu&quot; 
    recursive=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above specifies that all packages that have <code>com.mysite.sound.</code> 
  as a prefix can be found in the <code>part</code> named <code>stu</code>. The 
  <code>recursive</code> attribute only has an effect when used with a package 
  name, i.e., a name that ends with &quot;<code>.*</code>&quot;. </p>
<p>The package element only makes sense to use with lazily-downloaded resources, 
  since all other resources will already be available to the JVM. Thus, it will 
  already know what packages are implemented in those JAR files. However, it can 
  direct the JNLP Client to download the right lazy JAR resources, instead of 
  having to download each individual resource one at a time to check.</p>
<h2><a name="java"></a>4.6 Java Runtime Environment</h2>
<p>The <code>java</code> element (or the <code>j2se</code> element) (sub-element of <code>resources</code>) specifies 
  what Java Runtime Environment (JRE) versions an application is supported 
  on, as well as standard parameters to the Java Virtual Machine. Several JREs 
  can be specified, which indicates a prioritized list of the supported JREs, 
  with the most preferred version first. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;java version=&quot;1.3&quot; initial-heap-size=&quot;64m&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &lt;java version=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;resources&gt; ... &lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    &lt;/java&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The java element in the application descriptor defines the version of java 
  used to run the application (or applet). Any java element in an extension descriptor 
  is ignored.</p>
<p>The j2se element can be used interchangably with the java element for backward compatibility.</p>
<p><strong><code>version</code> attribute:</strong> Describes supported versions 
  of the JRE. The exact syntax and interpretation of the version string is described 
  in Section 4.6.1.</p>
<p><strong><code>initial-heap-size</code> attribute:</strong> Indicates the initial 
  size of the Java heap. The modifiers m and k can be used for megabytes and kilobytes, 
  respectively. For example, &quot;<code>128m</code>&quot; will be the same as 
  specifying &quot;<code>134217728</code>&quot; (128*1024*1024). The modifiers 
  are not case-sensitive.</p>
<p><strong><code>max-heap-size attribute</code>:</strong> Indicates the maximum 
  size of the Java heap. The modifiers m and k can be used for megabytes and kilobytes, 
  respectively. For example, &quot;<code>128m</code>&quot; will be the same as 
  specifying &quot;<code>134217728</code>&quot; (128*1024*1024). The modifiers 
  are not case-sensitive.</p>
<p><strong><code>resources</code> element:</strong> A <code>java</code> element 
  can contain nested <code>resources</code> elements. If the JRE specified in 
  the enclosing <code>java</code> element is chosen by the JNLP Client, then the 
  resources specified in the nested resources also becomes part of the application's 
  resources, otherwise they are ignored. Any<code> java</code> element in this 
  resource element is ignored.</p>
<p><strong><code>java-vm-args</code>:</strong> Indicates an additional set of 
  standard and non-standard virtual machine arguments that the application would 
  prefer the JNLP Client to use when launching Java, such as: <code>-server</code>, 
  <code>-client</code>, <code>-Xint</code>, <code>-Xincgc</code>, <code>-Xnoclassgc</code>, 
  and <code>-Xssn</code>. The JNLP Client may honor this preference only if it 
  considers each argument to be secure. </p>
<h3>4.6.1 Java Runtime Environment Version Specification</h3>
<p>A JRE can be specified in two ways in the JNLP file. It can be specified in 
  a vendor-independent manner by referring to a particular platform version of 
  the Java 2 platform, or it can be specified by using a product version of a 
  particular JRE vendor's implementation. </p>
<h4>Definition: Platform version</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is the version of a particular revision of the Java 2 platform. A platform 
    version describes a particular set of APIs (classes and interfaces), semantics, 
    and syntax of the Java 2 platform. </p>
  <p>The version id is of the form &quot;<code>x.y</code>&quot;. Occasionally, 
    dot-dot releases can be released, like &quot;<code>x.y.z</code>&quot;. This 
    would typically be in response to a security update. Current versions (as 
    of this writing) are 1.2 and 1.3. </p>
  <p>The platform version of a JRE can be determined by examining the <code>java.specification.version</code> 
    system property.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Definition: Product version</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is the version of a particular implementation of the Java 2 platform. 
    The product version is vendor-specific. A product implements a specific platform 
    version. The product version and platform versions are not necessarily related.</p>
  <p>The product version can be found by examining the <code>java.version</code> 
    system property<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#10','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">10</a></SUP>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If no <code>href</code> attribute is specified, the <code>version</code> string 
  refers to a platform version of the Java 2 platform. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;java version=&quot;1.6&quot;&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The JNLP Client can select any JRE implementation that implements this particular 
  revision (as given by the <code>java.specification.version</code> system property).</p>
<p>If an <code>href</code> attribute is specified, a vendor-specific JRE is requested. 
  A specific JRE implementation is uniquely named using a URL and a product version. 
  For example<SUP><a href="javascript::" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#11','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">11</a></SUP>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;java href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/javase&quot; version=&quot;1.5+&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The product version of a JRE implementation can be extracted from the <code>java.version</code> 
  system property. Each JRE vendor will be responsible for providing the unique 
  URL that names their particular implementations. </p>
<p>As a general rule, a product version should typically be specified using a 
  prefix or a greater-than notation, i.e., be postfixed with either a plus (<code>+</code>) 
  or an asterisk (<code>*</code>). This will obviously put less download strain 
  on the client, since a greater set of JVM implementations can be used. However, 
  more importantly, a specific product version might be obsolete due to, e.g., 
  due to a security problem. If this happens, the user will be unable to run the particular 
  application, if the JNLP file does not specify that a later version with the 
  particular problem fixed can be used.</p>
<p>Section 6.4 explains how the URL can also be used by the JNLP Client to download 
  and install a JRE, if it is not already present on the local machine.</p>
<h3><a name="selecting"></a>4.6.2 Selecting which JRE to Use</h3>
<p>The JNLP Client can choose any of the JRE combinations that are specified in 
  the JNLP file. Consider the following JNLP file fragment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;resources os=&quot;Windows&quot; arch=&quot;x86&quot;&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;java href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/...&quot; version=&quot;1.4.2_07&quot;&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;resources&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;http://www.mysite.com/app122.jar&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;extension name=&quot;MyExt&quot; href=&quot;http:...&quot; 
    version=&quot;3.4&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;property name=&quot;CheckThis&quot; 
    value=&quot;Wow&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/java&gt;<br>
    &lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    &lt;resources&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;java version=&quot;1.6&quot; initial-heap-size=&quot;64m&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &lt;/resources&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following two combinations would be legal to launch the application on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sun's JRE, version 1.4.2_07 given that you are running on the Windows 
    operating system and the x86 architecture.</li>
  <li>Any JRE compatible with the Java Platform, Standard Edition, version 6. No special extensions 
    are needed and no operating system nor architecture constraints are specified.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the specified JRE/extensions combinations are already installed on 
  the client machine, then the one listed earliest in the list should be used. 
  If none are installed, the JNLP client may pick which one to download and install. 
  In general, JRE/extensions combinations that appear earlier in the list should 
  be preferred over ones that appear later; however, the JNLP Client may take 
  other factors into account, such as minimizing download times. The download 
  and installation procedure for JREs and extensions is described in Section 6.</p>
<p>JRE-specific resources can be specified by including a nested <code>resources</code> 
  element inside a <code>java</code> element. The nested <code>resources</code> 
  elements are all ignored, except the one in the <code>java</code> element that 
  is used to launch the application. Thus, in the above example, if the application 
  is launched using Sun's 1.4.2_07 JRE, then the property <code>CheckThis</code> 
  will be set to <code>Wow</code>, and the <code>app122.jar</code> JAR file will 
  be part of the application's <code>resources</code>, as well as the <code>MyExt</code> 
  <code>extension</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="extension"></a>4.7 Extension Resources</h2>
<p>Extension descriptors can be included as part of the resources for an application 
  (or extension) by using the <code>extension</code> element. For example:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;resources&gt;<br>
    &nbsp; ...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;extension name=&quot;Sound&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;href=&quot;http://www.myext.com/servlet/ext/sound-extension.jnlp&quot;&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ext-download ext-part=&quot;MIDI&quot;/&gt;<br>

<p>The <code>extension</code> element contains three attributes: <code>name</code>, 
  <code>version</code>, and <code>href</code>. The <code>href</code> and the optional 
  <code>version</code> attributes uniquely identify the extension. This <code>href</code> 
  typically does not point to a file but to, e.g., a servlet that understands 
  the extension download protocol. The extension itself is described by an extension 
  descriptor, i.e., a JNLP File. How the extension descriptor is downloaded is 
  described in Section 6. The name attribute can be used by the JNLP Client to 
  inform the user about the particular extension that is required, while the extension 
  descriptor (i.e., the JNLP file) is being downloaded. </p>
<p>The inclusion of an <code>extension</code> element in a <code>resources</code> 
  element has the following effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If it points to a component extension (i.e., a JNLP file with a <code>component-desc</code> 
    element), then the resources described in the <code>resources</code> element 
    in that JNLP file become part of the application's resources. The included 
    resources will have the permissions specified in the component extension.</li>
  <li>If the extension points to an extension installer (i.e., a JNLP file with 
    an installer-desc element), then the installer application will be executed, 
    if it has not already been executed on the local machine. This is described 
    in detail in Section <a href="launch.html#launching">5.2</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For an extension element that points to component extension, it can also be 
  specified when the different parts of the component extension should be downloaded. 
  This is done using the <code>ext-download</code> sub-elements. In the above 
  example, the extension part <code>MIDI</code> is specified to be downloaded 
  eagerly, and the part in the extension descriptor named <code>MP3</code> must 
  be downloaded at the same time as the part named <code>MP3Player</code> in the 
  JNLP file containing the <code>extension</code> element. Note that a JNLP Client 
  is always allowed to eagerly download all parts if it chooses. This is all described 
  in more detail in Section 4.4. </p>
<p>Given the example above, and if the extension descriptor for the Sound extension 
  contains the following component extension:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;jnlp&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;resources&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;http://www.myext.com/lib/midi.jar&quot; 
    part=&quot;MIDI&quot;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;download=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;http://www.myext.com/lib/mp3.jar&quot; 
    part=&quot;MP3&quot;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;download=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;component-desc/&gt;<br>
    </code><code>&lt;/jnlp&gt;</code></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>then the <code>extension</code> element in the previous example would be, in 
  effect<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#12','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">12</a></SUP>, 
  replaced with the following two JAR files specified in the extension descriptor:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;resources&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;http://www.myext.com/lib/midi.jar&quot; download=&quot;eager&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;http://www.myext.com/lib/mp3.jar&quot; download=&quot;lazy&quot; 
    part=&quot;MP3Player&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
    &lt;/resources&gt;</code></p>
