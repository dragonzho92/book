<h1>A Version IDs and Version Strings </h1>
<hr>
<p>This section is simply a formal encoding of common conventions for dot-notations. 
  The formal syntax is to ensure predictable behavior of the download protocols. 
</p>
<p>This section describes the formal syntax of the version-ids and version strings 
  used in this specification. A version-id is an exact version that is associated 
  with a resource, such as a JAR file. A version string is a key that can match 
  one or more version-ids. </p>
<p>The version-id used in this specification must conform to the following syntax:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>version-id ::= string ( separator string ) *<br>
    string &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;::= char ( char ) *<br>
    char &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;::= any ASCII character except a 
    space, an ampersand, a <SPAN LANG="en-US">separator</SPAN>, or a modifier. 
    <br>
    separator &nbsp;::= &quot;.&quot; | &quot;-&quot; | &quot;_&quot; </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A version string is a list of version-ids separated with spaces. Each version-id 
  can be postfixed with a '+' to indicate a greater-than-or-equal match, a &quot;*&quot; 
  to indicated a prefix match, or have no postfix to indicate an exact match. 
  The syntax of version-strings is:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>version-string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::=&nbsp; version-range ( &quot; 
    &quot; element) * <BR>
    version-range&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;::=&nbsp; simple-range ( &quot;&amp;&quot; 
    simple-element) * <BR>
    simple-range&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;::=&nbsp; version-id | version-id 
    modifier <BR>
    modifier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;::=&nbsp; 
    `+` | '*' </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A version-id can be described as a tuple of values. A version-id string is 
  broken in parts for each separator ('.', '-', or '_'). For example, &quot;1.3.0-rc2-w&quot; 
  becomes (1,3,0,rc2,w), and &quot;1.2.2-001&quot; becomes (1,2,2,001).</p>
<p>Each element in a tuple is treated as either a numeric or alphanumeric. Two 
  elements are compared numerically if they can both be parsed as Java <code>ints</code>, 
  otherwise they are compared lexicographically according to the ASCII value<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#15','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">15</a></SUP> 
  of the individual characters. </p>
<p>Before two version-ids are compared the two tuples are <em>normalized</em>. 
  This means that the shortest tuple is padded with 0 (zero element) entries at 
  the end. Two normalized tuples are always of the same length. For example, comparing 
  (1, 3) and (1, 3, 1), will result in comparing (1, 3, 0) and (1, 3, 1). </p>
<h2>A.1 Ordering</h2>
<p>The version-ids are ordered by the natural ordering of dot-notations. </p>
<p>A normalized version-id tuple can be written as (<em>Head Tail</em>), where 
  <em>Head</em> is the first element in the tuple, and <em>Tail</em> is the rest<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#16','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">16</a></SUP>. 
</p>
<p>Given two version-ids, (HA TA) and (HB TB), then (HA TA) is greater than (HB 
  TB) if and only if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HA is greater than HB, or</li>
  <li>HA is equal to HB, TA and TB are not empty, and TA is greater than TB recursively</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, A is greater than B if, when represented as normalized tuples, 
  there exists some element of A which is greater than the corresponding element 
  of B, and all earlier elements of A are the same as in B.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;1.2.2&quot; is greater than &quot;1.2&quot;, and less than 
  &quot;1.3&quot; (i.e., in effect, comparing &quot;1.2.2&quot;, &quot;1.2.0&quot;, 
  and &quot;1.3.0&quot;)</p>
<h2>A.2 Exact Match</h2>
<p>Two normalized version-ids, (HA TA) and (HB TB), match exactly if and only 
  if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HA is equal to HB and </li>
  <li>TA and TB are both empty, or TA matches TB exactly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, A is an exact match of B if, when represented as normalized 
  tuples, the elements of A are the same as the elements of B.</p>
<p>For example, given the above definition &quot;1.2.2-004&quot; will be an exact 
  match for &quot;1.2.2.4&quot;, and &quot;1.3&quot; is an exact match of &quot;1.3.0&quot;.</p>
<h2>A.3 Prefix Match</h2>
<p>Given two version-ids, (HA TA) and (HB TB), then first (HB TB) is padded with 
  0 (zero element) entries at the end so it is at least the same length as the 
  (HA TA) tuple. </p>
<p>(HA TA) is a prefix match of (HB TB) if and only if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HA is equal to HB, and
    <ul>
      <li>TA is empty, or</li>
      <li>TA is a prefix match of TB</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, A is a prefix match of B if, when represented as tuples, the 
  elements of A are the same as the first elements of B. The padding ensures that 
  B has at least as many elements as A.</p>
<p>For example, given the above definition &quot;1.2.1&quot; will be a prefix 
  match to &quot;1.2.1-004&quot;, but not to &quot;1.2.0&quot; or &quot;1.2.10&quot;. 
  The padding step ensures that &quot;1.2.0.0&quot; is a prefix of &quot;1.2&quot;. 
  Note that prefix matching and ordering are distinct: &quot;1.3&quot; is greater 
  than &quot;1.2&quot;, and less than &quot;1.4&quot;, but not a prefix of either.</p>
<h2>A.4 Version Selection </h2>
<p> If two or more available resources match the given version-string, the JNLP 
  Client should use the one matching the earlier version-range in the version-string. 
  If two or more available resources match a given version-range, the JNLP Client 
  should use the one with the<SPAN LANG="en-US"> highest </SPAN>version-id. </p>
