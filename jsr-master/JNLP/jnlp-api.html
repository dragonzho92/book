<h1>7 JNLP API </h1>
<hr>
<br>
A JNLP Client must provide a set of additional services to the launched application 
through the javax.jnlp package. These services let an application interact with 
the surrounding environment in a secure and platform-independent way. The JNLP 
API is available to all applications whether or not a particular application is 
trusted. <a href="d.html">Appendix D</a> contains a list of all methods and classes 
with complete signatures. For a detailed description of the JNLP API, consult 
the JNLP API Reference, v1.0. 
<p>A service is structured as an object implementing a specific JNLP service interface. 
  The following services are defined:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>BasicService</code>, which provides a service similar to the <code>AppletContext</code>. 
    This service must always be provided.</li>
  <li><code>DownloadService</code>, which allows an application to interact with 
    the JNLP Client to check if application resources are available locally, and 
    to request them to be downloaded. This service must always be provided.</li>
  <li><code>FileOpenService</code>, which allows applications running in the untrusted 
    environment to import files from the local disk. This service is optional.</li>
  <li><code>FileSaveService</code>, which allows applications running in the untrusted 
    environment to export files to the local disk. This service is optional.</li>
  <li><code>ClipboardService</code>, which allows applications running in the 
    untrusted environment access to the clipboard. This service is optional.</li>
  <li><code>PrintService</code>, which allows applications running in the untrusted 
    environment access to printing. This service is optional.</li>
  <li><code>PersistenceService</code>, which allows applications running in the 
    untrusted environment access to store state locally on the client. This service 
    is optional.</li>
  <li><code>ExtensionInstallerService</code>, which provides an interface for 
    extension installers to communicate with the JNLP Client. This service is 
    required.</li>
  <li><code>SingleInstanceService</code>, which provides a set of methods for 
    applications to register themselves as singletons, and to register listener(s) 
    for handling arguments passed in from different instances of the application. 
    This service is optional.</li>
  <li><code>ExtendedService</code>, which provide additional support to the existing 
    APIs. This service is optional. </li>
</ul>
<p>A service object is found using the static <code>lookup</code> method on the 
  <code>ServiceManager</code> class. This method will, given a <code>String</code> 
  representing the service name, return an object implementing the given service. 
  The <code>lookup</code> method must be idempotent, i.e., returning the same 
  object for each request for the same service. If a service is not available, 
  the <code>UnavailableServiceException</code> must be thrown. The <code>getServiceNames</code> 
  methods returns the names of all supported services.</p>
<p>The recommended name for a service is the fully qualified name of the interface, 
  e.g., <code>javax.jnlp.BasicService</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="basic"></a>7.1 The <code>BasicService</code> Service</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.BasicService</code> service provides a set of methods 
  for querying and interacting with the environment similar to what the <code>AppletContext</code> 
  provides for a Java Applet. </p>
<p>The <code>getCodebase</code> method returns the codebase for the application. 
  This will typically be the URL specified in the <code>codebase</code> attribute 
  in the <code>jnlp</code> element. However, if the JNLP file does not specify 
  this attribute, then the codebase is defined to be the URL of the JAR file containing 
  the class with the <code>main</code> method. </p>
<p>The <code>isOffline</code> method returns true if the application is running 
  without access to the network. An application can use this method to adjust 
  its behavior to work properly in an offline environment. The method provides 
  a hint from the JNLP Client. The network might be unavailable, even though the 
  JNLP Client indicated that it was, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The <code>showDocument</code> method displays the given URL in a Web browser. 
  This may be the default browser on the platform, or it may be chosen by the 
  JNLP Client some other way. This method returns false if the request failed, 
  or the operation is not supported.</p>
<p>Some platforms might not support a browser, or the JNLP Client might not be 
  configured to use a browser. The <code>isWebBrowserSupported</code> method will 
  return true if a Web browser is supported, otherwise false.</p>
<h2><a name="download"></a>7.2 The <code>DownloadService</code> Service</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.DownloadService</code> service allows an application to 
  control how its own resources are cached.</p>
<p>The service allows an application to determine which of its resources are currently 
  cached, to force resources to be cached, and to remove resources from the cache. 
</p>
<p>The following three query methods return true if a given resource, a given 
  part, or a given part of a given extension is currently cached, respectively. 
  In an untrusted environement, these methods must always return false for resources that are not from 
the codebase of current application, and are not mentioned in the JNLP file(s) of the application.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>isResourceCached</code></li>
  <li><code>isPartCached</code></li>
  <li><code>isExtensionPartCached</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The following three methods instruct the JNLP Client to download a given resource, 
  a given part, or a given part of a given extension, respectively. The methods 
  block until the download is completed or an error occurs. In an untrusted environment, these methods must 
  always fail for resources that are not from the codebase of current 
  application, and are not mentioned in the JNLP file(s) of the application.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>loadResource</code></li>
  <li><code>loadPart</code></li>
  <li><code>loadExtensionPart</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The above methods take a <code>DownloadServiceListener</code> object as argument 
  that can track the progress of the download. A default implementation of a listener 
  can be obtained by the <code>getDefaultProgressWindow</code> method. </p>
<p>The following three methods instruct the JNLP Client to remove a given resource, 
  a given part, or a given part of a given extension from the cache, respectively. 
  The remove request is a hint to the JNLP Client that the given resource is no 
  longer needed. In an untrusted environment, these methods must do nothing if a resource is not from the
  codebase of the current application, and is not mentioned in the JNLP 
  file(s) of the application.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>removeResource</code></li>
  <li><code>removePart</code></li>
  <li><code>removeExtensionPart</code></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="file_open"></a>7.3 The <code>FileOpenService</code> Service</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.FileOpenService</code> service provides methods for importing 
  files from the local disk, even for applications that are running in the untrusted 
  execution environment.</p>
<p>This interface is designed to provide the same level of disk access to potentially 
  untrusted Web-deployed applications that a Web developer has when using HTML. 
  HTML forms support the inclusion of files by displaying a file open dialog. 
</p>
<p>A file open dialog can be displayed to the user with the following two methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>openFileDialog</code></li>
  <li><code>openMultiFileDialog</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The methods allow selection of exactly one file or multiple files, respectively.</p>
<p>The contents of a file are returned in a <code>FileContents</code> object. 
  A <code>FileContents</code> encapsulates the name of the selected file and provides 
  metered access to the contents. The contents can be accessed using input streams, 
  output streams, or random access. The JNLP Client might enforce size limits 
  on the amount of data that can be written. </p>
<p>The <code>FileContents</code> only knows the name of the selected file excluding 
  the path. Thus, the open dialog cannot be used to obtain information about the 
  user's directory structure. </p>
<p>The JNLP Client can render the open file dialog in any way it sees fit. In 
  particular, it could show an additional security dialog or warning message to 
  the user before showing the dialog.</p>
<p>The methods will return <code>null</code> if the user chose to cancel the operation. 
  An <code>IOException</code> will be thrown if the operation failed for some 
  other reason than the user did not select a file.</p>
<p>On JNLP Clients running on disk-less systems, or systems that do not wish to 
  implement these features, the <code>ServiceManager</code> must throw an <code>UnavailableServiceException</code> 
  when this service is looked up.</p>
<h2><a name="file_save"></a>7.4 The <code>FileSaveService</code> Service</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.FileSaveService</code> service provides methods for exporting 
  files to the local disk, even for applications that are running in the untrusted 
  execution environment. </p>
<p>This interface is designed to provide the same level of disk access to potentially 
  untrusted Web-deployed Java applications, that a Web browser provides for contents 
  that it is displaying. Most Web browsers provide a <strong>Save As...</strong> 
  dialog as part of their user interface.</p>
<p>A file save dialog can be displayed to the user by invoking the <code>saveFileDialog</code> 
  or the <code>saveAsFileDialog</code> methods. </p>
<p>The JNLP Client can render the save file dialog in any way it sees fit. In 
  particular, it could show an additional security dialog or warning message to 
  the user before an action is committed.</p>
<p>The methods return a <code>FileContents</code> object representing the file 
  that was saved, or return <code>null</code> if the user chose to cancel the 
  operation. An <code>IOException</code> will be thrown if the operation failed 
  for some other reason than the user decided not to save the file.</p>
<p>On JNLP Clients running on disk-less systems, or systems that do not wish to 
  implement this service, the <code>ServiceManager</code> must throw an <code>UnavailableServiceException</code> 
  when this service is looked up.</p>
<h2><a name="clipboard"></a>7.5 The <code>ClipboardService</code> Service</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.ClipboardService</code> service provides methods for accessing 
  the shared, system-wide clipboard, even for applications that are running in 
  the untrusted execution environment.</p>
<p>A JNLP Client implementing this service should warn the user of the potential 
  security risk of letting an untrusted application access potentially confidential 
  information stored in the clipboard, or overwriting contents stored in the clipboard.</p>
<p>The interface consists of two methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>setContents</code></li>
  <li><code>getContents</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The two methods are analogues to the methods on <code>java.awt.datatransfer.Clipboard</code>, 
  except that the JNLP API does not support owner notification or retrieving the 
  name of the contents.</p>
<h2><a name="print"></a>7.6 The <code>PrintService</code> Service </h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.PrintService</code> service provides methods for accessing 
  to printing even for applications that are running in the untrusted execution 
  environment. </p>
<p>This service is designed to provide (somewhat) similar access to printing as 
  an HTML-based application has through the browser. Using this service, an application 
  can submit a print job to the JNLP Client. The JNLP Client can then show this 
  request to the user, and if accepted queue the request to the printer.</p>
<p>The service provides a <code>print</code> method that can either take a <code>Pageable</code> 
  object or a <code>Printable</code> object. The method will return <code>true</code> 
  if the printing succeeded, otherwise it will return <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>The interface also provides a set of methods to get the current page format:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>getDefaultPage</code></li>
  <li><code>showPageFormatDialog</code></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="persistence"></a>7.7 The <code>PersistenceService</code> Service</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.PersistenceService</code> service provides methods for 
  storing data locally on the client system, even for applications that are running 
  in the untrusted execution environment. </p>
<p>The service is designed to be (somewhat) similar to that which the cookie mechanism 
  provides to HTML-based applications. Cookies allow a small amount of data to 
  be stored locally on the client system. That data can be securely managed by 
  the browser and can only be retrieved by HTML pages which originate from the 
  same URL as the page that stored the data.</p>
<p>Each entry in the persistent data store is stored on the local system, indexed 
  by a URL, i.e, using a URL as a key. This provides a similar hierarchical structure 
  as a traditional file system. An application is only allowed to access data 
  stored with a URL (i.e., key) that is based on its codebase. The URL must follow 
  the directory structure of the codebase for a particular application. For example, 
  given the codebase, <code>http://www.mysite.com/apps/App1/</code>, the application 
  would be allowed to access data at the associated URLs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>http://www.mysite.com/apps/App1/</code></li>
  <li><code>http://www.mysite.com/apps/</code></li>
  <li><code>http://www.mysite.com/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This scheme allows sharing of data between different applications from the 
  same host. For example, if another application is located at <code>http://www.mysite.com/apps/App2/</code>, 
  then they can share data between them in the <code>http://www.mysite.com/</code> 
  and <code>http://www.mysite.com/apps/</code> directories. Any data that App1 
  wants to keep private from <code>App2</code> can be stored at <code>http://www.mysite.com/apps/App1</code>.</p>
<p>The following methods are used to create, access, and delete entries. These 
  methods all take a URL as an argument. </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>create</code></li>
  <li><code>get</code></li>
  <li><code>delete</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>get</code> method returns the contents of the entry as a <code>FileContents 
  </code>object. The <code>FileContents</code> interface provides metered access 
  to the underlying data, i.e., ensures that the application does not write more 
  data to disk than it is allowed. The <code>create</code> method takes a long 
  argument that specifies that maximum size of the given entry. If this maximum 
  size limit is exceeded when performing a write operation, an <code>IOException</code> 
  must be thrown. The application can use the <code>setMaxSize</code> method on 
  a <code>FileContents</code> object to request additional space.</p>
<p>A JNLP Client should keep track the amount of storage that a given application 
  uses. The total amount of storage is the sum of the maximum sizes of all the 
  entries that the application has access to. The default limit of the amount 
  of total storage available to an application is JNLP Client specific, but should 
  typically not be less than 128KB. </p>
<p>The <code>delete</code> method removes an entry from the persistence cache.</p>
<p>The <code>getNames</code> method returns the names of all entries in a given 
  directory.</p>
<p>Data stored using this mechanism is intended to be a local copy of data stored 
  on a remote server. Using a local cache can improve performance, as well as 
  make it possible to run applications offline. The individual entries can be 
  tagged as being either </p>
<ol>
  <li><code>CACHED</code>, meaning that the server has an up-to-date copy;</li>
  <li><code>DIRTY</code>, meaning that the server does not have an up-to-date 
    copy; or </li>
  <li><code>TEMPORARY</code>, meaning that this file can always be recreated. 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The following two methods support tags:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>setTag</code></li>
  <li><code>getTag</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The tag information can be used by a JNLP Client when cleaning out the persistent 
  cache. Entries tagged as <code>TEMPORARY</code> should be removed first, followed 
  by entries tagged as <code>CACHED</code>, and then entries tagged as <code>DIRTY</code>. 
  The JNLP Client should always warn the user that unsaved data might be lost 
  when removing an entry marked as <code>DIRTY</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="extension"></a>7.8 The <code>ExtensionInstallerService</code> Service</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.ExtensionInstallerService</code> service provides methods 
  for an extension installer to manipulate the progress screen during a download 
  and install, as well as methods for informing the JNLP Client where to find 
  the resources it installed. </p>
<p>The <code>ExtensionInstallerService</code> is only available when the JNLP 
  Client is running an extension installer. Otherwise, the <code>ServiceManager</code> 
  should throw an <code>UnavailableServiceException</code> when this service is 
  looked up. </p>
<p>An extension installer is a Java Technology-based application that is responsible 
  for installing platform-dependent code and settings for an extension.</p>
<p>The extension installer provides three kinds of services to the installer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to manipulate a progress window provided by the JNLP Client. 
    The calls can be ignored if the JNLP Client does not implement a progress 
    window.</li>
  <li>Query the JNLP Client about the preferred location for the installation 
    and previous installations.</li>
  <li>Update the JNLP Client with information about the native parts of an extension. 
    This will either be a list of native libraries that need to be linked into 
    an application that uses the extension, or if the extension installs a JRE, 
    how the JRE is to be launched.</li>
</ul>
<p>The manipulation of the progress window is done using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>setStatus</code></li>
  <li><code>setHeading</code></li>
  <li><code>updateProgress</code></li>
  <li><code>hideProgressBar</code></li>
  <li><code>hideStatusWindow </code></li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion of a progress window API should make it possible to write installers 
  that look good on a wide variety of platforms. The JNLP Client will be responsible 
  for the look and feel of the window. The progress window is assumed to already 
  be showing when the extension installer is launched, e.g., it has just been 
  used by the JNLP Client itself to show that the extension is being installed. 
</p>
<p>The <code>getInstallPath</code> provides a preferred location where the extension 
  should be installed. A JNLP Client will typically create a directory under its 
  own tree and return the location of that directory. The installer can then install 
  all required files without creating a conflict with other installed extensions. 
</p>
<p>The <code>getExtensionVersion</code> and <code>getExtensionLocation</code> 
  methods return the exact <code>version-id</code> and location of the extension 
  that is being installed. This information would typically already be known by 
  the installer, but is provided so that it is possible to write generic installers 
  that work with multiple versions.</p>
<p>The <code>setJREInfo</code> and s<code>etNativeLibraryInfo</code> methods are 
  used to update the JNLP Client with information about the native code an installer 
  might install. Only one of them can be called by a particular extension. The 
  <code>setJREInfo</code> is used by an extension that installs a JRE. It must 
  be called with the path to the executable that launches the JVM. The s<code>etNativeLibraryInfo</code> 
  method is used to instruct the JNLP Client to include the given directory in 
  the search path for native libraries when the <code>System.loadLibrary</code> 
  method is used.</p>
<p>The <code>installSucceeded</code> method must be called when the installer 
  finished successfully. The <code>installFailed</code> method must be called 
  if the installation failed. In case of a failed install, the installer is responsible 
  for providing an error message to the user. After either of the methods are 
  called, the installer should quit, and the JNLP Client should regain control 
  and continue with its operation, e.g., continue launching the application that 
  forced the extension to be downloaded and installed, or abort the launch if 
  the the installation failed. An installer should not call <code>System.exit</code>.</p>
<p>The following method can be used by an installer to figure out the location 
  of already-installed JREs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>getInstalledJRE</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This allow an extension to potentially update a particular JRE by installing 
  JAR files into, e.g., the <code>lib/ext</code> directory.</p>
<p>The normal sequence of events for an extension installer is: </p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the <code>ExtensionInstallerService</code> from 
  the <code>ServiceManager</code>. The installer can then use the <code>getInstallPath</code> 
  to find out the preferred installation directory.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Update status, heading, and progress as the install 
  progresses (<code>setStatus</code>, <code>setHeading</code>, <code>updateProgress</code>, 
  and <code>hideProgressBar</code>). If the installer uses its own progress window, 
  the JNLP Client supplied one can be disposed using the <code>hideStatusWindow</code> 
  method.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If successful, inform the JNLP Client about the installed 
  contents, by invoking either <code>setJREInfo</code> or <code>setNativeLibraryInfo</code>, 
  as appropriate for the installer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Inform the JNLP Client about the completion of the 
  installer. If successful, invoke <code>installSucceeded</code>. If not successful 
  invoke <code>installFailed</code>. This will cause the JNLP Client to regain 
  control, and continue with the launch sequence. An installer that must reboot 
  the client system indicates that in the call of <code>installSucceeded</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="SingleInstanceService"></a>7.9 The <code>SingleInstanceService</code> 
  Service </h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.SingleInstanceService</code> provides a set of methods 
  for applications to register themselves as singletons, and to register listener(s) 
  for handling arguments passed in from different instances of the application. 
  The application can register and unregister itself with the following two methods: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>addSingleInstanceListener(javax.jnlp.SingleInstanceListener listener)</code></li>
  <li><code>removeSingleInstanceListener(javax.jnlp.SingleInstanceListener listener) 
    </code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>addSingleInstanceListener</code> method adds the specified <code>SingleInstanceListener</code> 
  to handle how the application should behave when another instance of the same 
  application is invoked. If the <code>SingleInstanceListener</code> is null, 
  no exception is thrown and no action is performed. Multiple listeners can be 
  added for the application. If the same listener is added twice, no action is 
  performed. </p>
<p>The <code>removeSingleInstanceListener</code> method removes the specified 
  <code>SingleInstanceListener</code>. This method performs no function, nor does 
  it throw an exception, if the listener specified by the argument was not previously 
  added to the application. If listener is null, no exception is thrown and no 
  action is performed. It is recommended that if an application registers a <code>SingleInstanceListener</code>, 
  it should call this method to remove the listener upon exit. </p>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.SingleInstanceListener</code> is the interface for the 
  <code>SingleInstanceListener</code>. The application requesting <code>SingleInstanceService</code> 
  should implement this interface, providing an implementation of the following 
  method: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>newActivation(String[] params) </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arguments from the instances of the application will be passed into the <code>newActivation</code> 
  method, and an application developer can decide on how to handle the arguments 
  passed by implementating this method.</p>
<h2><a name="ExtendedService"></a>7.10 The <code>ExtendedService</code> Service 
</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.jnlp.ExtendedService</code> provides additional support to 
  the current JNLP API. It allows applications to open specific file(s) in the 
  client's file system.</p>
<p>The application can request access to specific file(s) using the following 
  two methods: </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>openFile(File file) </code></li>
  <li><code>openFiles(File[] files)</code> </li>
</ul>
<p>A dialog should be presented to the user asking for permissions to access the 
  specific file(s). The JNLP client can render the dialog in any way it sees fit. 
</p>
<p>The contents of the file(s) are returned in a <code>FileContents</code> object. 
  A <code>FileContents</code> encapsulates the name of the selected file and provides 
  metered access to the contents. The contents can be accessed using input streams, 
  output streams, or random access. The JNLP client might enforce size limits 
  on the amount of data that can be written. </p>
<p>The methods will return <code>null</code> if the user chooses to cancel the 
  operation or passes in <code>null</code> as an argument. An <code>IOException</code> 
  will be thrown if the operation fails.</p>
