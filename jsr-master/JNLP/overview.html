  The Java Network Launching Protocol and API (JNLP) is a Web-centric provisioning<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#1','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')">1</a></SUP> 
  protocol and application environment for Web-deployed Java applications. An application implementing this specification is called a JNLP 
  Client. </p>
<p>The main concepts in this specification are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Web-centric application model with no installation phase, which provides 
    transparent and incremental updates, as well as incremental downloading of 
    an application. This is similar to the model for HTML pages and Applets, but 
    with greater control and flexibility.</li>
  <li>A provisioning protocol that describes how to package an application on 
    a Web server, so it can be delivered across the Web to a set of JNLP Clients. 
    The key component in this provisioning protocol is the JNLP file, which describes 
    how to download and launch an application.</li>
  <li>A standard execution environment for the application. The execution environment 
    includes both a safe environment where access to the local disk and the network 
    is restricted for untrusted applications, and an unrestricted environment 
    for trusted applications. The restricted environment is similar to the well-known 
    Applet sandbox, but extended with additional APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main concepts are introduced in the following sections.</p>
<h2><a name="web"></a>1.1 Web-centric Application Model</h2>
<p>A JNLP Client is an application or service that can launch applications on 
  a client system from resources hosted across the network. It is not a general 
  installation protocol for software components. A high-level view of a JNLP Client 
  is that it allows an application to be run from a codebase that is accessed 
  over the Web, rather than from the local file system. It provides a facility 
  similar to what would happen if URLs were allowed in the JRE's classpath, e.g., 
  something that looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>java -classpath http://www.mysite.com/app/MyApp.jar com.mysite.app.Main</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above example illustrates the basic functionality of a JNLP Client. JNLP 
  goes further than this, however. First, it provides the ability to specify which 
  version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that the application requires. In the above 
  example, this amounts to choosing what java command to use. If the requested 
  JRE version is not available, a JRE can be downloaded and installed automatically<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#2','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')"><SUP>2</SUP></a>. 
  Second, it provides the ability to specify native libraries as part of the application. 
  Native libraries are downloaded in JAR files. Thus, both signing and compression 
  of the libraries are supported. The native libraries are loaded into the running 
  process using the System.loadLibrary method. </p>
<p>All the resources that an JNLP Client needs to access in order to launch an 
  application are referenced with URLs. Conceptually, all of the application's 
  resources reside on the Web server. A JNLP Client is allowed and encouraged 
  to cache resources that are downloaded from the Web. This will improve consecutive 
  startup times, minimize network traffic, and enable offline operation.</p>
<p>This application model provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No installation phase:</strong> A JNLP Client simply needs to download 
    and cache the application's resources. The user does not need to be prompted 
    about install directories and the like.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparent update:</strong> A JNLP Client can check the currently 
    cached resources against the versions hosted on the Web Server and transparently 
    download newer versions.</li>
  <li><strong>Incremental update:</strong> The JNLP Client only needs to download 
    the resources that have been changed when an application is updated. If only 
    a few of the application's resources have been modified, this can significantly 
    reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded when upgrading to a 
    new version of an application. Furthermore, incremental update of individual 
    JAR files is also supported.</li>
  <li><strong>Incremental download:</strong> A JNLP Client does not need to download 
    an entire application before it is launched. For example, for a spreadsheet 
    application the downloading of the graphing module could be postponed until 
    first use. JNLP supports this model by allowing the developer to specify what 
    resources are needed before an application is launched (eager), and what resources 
    can be downloaded later (lazy). Furthermore, JNLP provides an API so the developer 
    can check if a resource is local or not (i.e., whether it needs to be downloaded), 
    and to request non-local resources to be downloaded.</li>
  <li><strong>Offline support:</strong> A JNLP Client can launch an application 
    offline if a sufficient set of resources is cached locally. However, most 
    applications deployed using JNLP are expected to be Web-centric, i.e., they 
    will typically connect back to a Web server or database to retrieve their 
    state. Hence, many applications will only work online. The application developer 
    specifies if offline operation is supported, and what resources are needed 
    locally to launch the application offline.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="provisioning"></a>1.2 Provisioning</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 JNLP File</h3>
<p>The core of the JNLP technology is the JNLP file. The JNLP file is an XML document. 
</p>
<p>Most commonly, a JNLP file will describe an application. A JNLP file of this 
  kind is called an application descriptor. It specifies the JAR files the application 
  consists of, the JRE it requires, optional packages that it depends 
  on, its name and other display information, its runtime parameters and system 
  properties, etc. There is a one-to-one correspondence between an application 
  descriptor and an application. </p>
<p>A JNLP file does not contain any binary data itself. Instead it contains URLs 
  that point to all binary data, such as icons (in JPEG or GIF format), and binary 
  code resources, such as Java classes and native libraries (contained in JAR 
  files). Figure 1 illustrates how an application is described with JNLP files. 
  The root JNLP file (application descriptor) contains the basic information such 
  as name and vendor, main class, and so forth. The JAR files that constitute 
  the &quot;classpath&quot; for the application are all referred to with URLs.</p>
<p>A JNLP file can also refer to other JNLP files, called extension descriptors. 
  An extension descriptor typically describes a component that must be used in 
  order to run the application. The resources described in the extension descriptor 
  become part of the classpath for the application. This allows common functionality 
  to be factored out and described once. An extension descriptor also provides 
  the ability to run an installer that can install platform-dependent resources 
  before the application is launched, e.g., to install device drivers.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/jnlp-spec-1.0.1-fcs-TEST_sdw_m73d3a86f.gif" width="364" height="191"></p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 1: JNLP File and External Resources</em></p>
<p>The JNLP file is, in some sense, similar to a traditional executable format. 
  Traditionally, applications are delivered as binary platform-dependent files. 
  For example, on Windows, an application is delivered as a MyApp.exe executable. 
  The executable format is designed so the Windows operating system can load the 
  application and execute it. It also contains information about external dependencies, 
  such as MyApp.dll. This format is file-centric; all external references 
  are references to files on the local file system. In contrast, a JNLP file does 
  not contain any binary data itself, but instead contains URLs to where they 
  can be obtained from. The JNLP file format is Web-centric; the references to 
  external resources are URLs, instead of file names. </p>
<h2>1.2.2 Downloading Resources</h2>
<p>The JNLP Client can download 3 different kind of resources: JAR files, images, 
  and JNLP files. All resources in a JNLP file are uniquely named using either 
  a URL or a URL/version-id pair. A typical application deployed using JNLP will 
  consist of a set of JAR files and a set of images<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#3','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=700')"><SUP>3</SUP></a>. 
  JAR files, images, and JNLP files can be downloaded using standard HTTP GET 
  requests. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>http://www.mysite.com/app/MyApp.jar</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This basic download protocol works from a standard unmodified Web server. This 
  leverages existing Web server technology, which is important to achieve wide-spread 
  use of a new technology on the Internet. </p>
<p>To provide more control and better utilization of bandwidth, a version-based 
  download protocol is also supported. The version-based protocol is designed 
  to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow several versions of an application to co-exist on a server at a given 
    time. In particular, this means that an application that is distributed as 
    several JAR files can be safely upgraded. A JNLP Client that is downloading 
    JAR files right when a Web server is being updated will never download JAR 
    files that are a mix between two application versions.</li>
  <li>Provide a unique URL for an application independent of its version. This 
    allows a JNLP Client to automatically detect and flush old versions out of 
    the cache.</li>
  <li>Make it possible to incrementally update already-downloaded JAR files. This 
    can substantially minimize the download requirements for upgrading to a new 
    version.</li>
  <li>Allow users to stick with a given version rather than always getting the 
    latest version from the Web server. For example, a JNLP Client can download 
    an updated version in the background, while the already-downloaded version 
    is being used.</li>
</ul>
<p>The version-based protocol requires special support on the Web server. This 
  support can be provided using servlets, CGI-scripts, or by similar means. </p>
<p>The use of the version-based protocol is specified in the JNLP file on a per-resource 
  basis. Depending on the facilities the Web server offers (and possibly other 
  factors), the application developer can choose whether the version-based protocol 
  should be used or not. </p>
<h2><a name="application"></a>1.3 Application Environment</h2>
<p>The application environment defines a common set of services and system settings 
  that an application launched with a JNLP Client can depend on. The core of this 
  environment is the JRE. In addition, this specification 
  defines additional APIs and settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configured HTTP proxies.</li>
  <li>A secure execution environment that is similar to the well-known Applet 
    sandbox.</li>
  <li>An API to securely and dynamically lookup and access features on the client 
    platform, such as instructing the default browser to display a URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application environment is defined as a set of required services that must 
  be implemented by all implementations that conform to this specification, and 
  a set of optional services that are not required to be implemented. Applications 
  must check for the presence of optional services and handle their absence sensibly.</p>
<h2><a name="example"></a>1.4 An Example</h2>
<p>A helper application that implements the Java Network Launching protocol and 
  API can be associated with a Web browser. The helper application gets configured 
  with the proper HTTP proxy settings during installation, so they can be passed 
  along to a launched application<SUP><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('notes.html#4','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=599,height=700')">4</a></SUP>. 
  Thus, the user does not have to specify proxy settings for each application 
  separately.</p>
<p>When a user clicks on a link pointing to a JNLP file, the browser will download 
  the file and invoke the helper application with the name of the downloaded file 
  as an argument. The helper application (i.e., the JNLP Client) interprets the 
  JNLP file, which will direct it to download and locally cache the JAR files 
  and other resources for the particular application. When all required JAR files 
  have been downloaded, the application is launched.</p>
<p>A sample JNLP file, which is an XML document, is shown here:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jnlp codebase=&quot;http://www.mysite.com/app&quot;&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;information&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Draw!&lt;/title&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;vendor&gt;My Web Company&lt;/vendor&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;icon href=&quot;draw-icon.jpg&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;offline-allowed/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/information&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;resources&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;java version=&quot;1.3+&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;jar href=&quot;draw.jar&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/resources&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;application-desc main-class=&quot;com.mysite.Draw&quot;/&gt;<br>
    &lt;/jnlp&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The JNLP file describes how to launch the sample application, titled Draw!. 
  In the JNLP file, it is specified that the Java platform, version 1.3 or higher 
  is required to run this application, along with some general application information 
  that can be displayed to the user during the download phase.</p>
<h2><a name="comparing"></a>1.5 Comparing JNLP with Other Technologies </h2>
<p>The JNLP technology is related to Java Applets. Java Applets are automatically 
  downloaded, cached, and launched by a Web browser without requiring any user 
  interaction, and Applets are executed in a secure sandbox environment by default. 
  Applets are a core part of the Java Platform, Standard Edition. Many of the technologies that are 
  used by JNLP are borrowed from the Applet technology, such as the downloading 
  of code and the secure sandbox. </p>
<p>Applications launched with JNLP do not run inside a browser window, but are 
  instead separate applications that are run on separate Java Virtual Machines 
  (JVMs). Thus, applications launched with JNLP are typically more like traditional 
  desktop applications that are commonly distributed as shrink-wrapped software, 
  e.g., on CDs.</p>
<p>JNLP is not a general installer for applications. It is particularly targeted 
  to Web-deployed Java Technology-based applications, i.e., applications that 
  can be downloaded from the Web and which store most of their state on the Web.</p>
<p>The JNLP protocol defines how Java Runtime Environments and optional packages 
  can be installed automatically. This will typically require the JREs and optional 
  packages to be bundled in a traditional installer.</p>
